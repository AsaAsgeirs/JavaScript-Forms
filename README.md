# JavaScript-Forms

The project was to make a Form in JavaScript.

I made a Submit Form with three inputs and a Submit button.

Each input has an icon in the left side of the input fields.

Each input also has an Error or an Success Icon that will appeare if you made a mistake or if you filled out the form correctly.

If you make an error a red text massage will appear under the input fields along with the error Icon. 

I styled the Submit Form in CSS.

I got the Icons from Ionicons.
